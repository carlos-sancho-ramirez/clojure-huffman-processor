# Clojure Huffman Processor

A simple clojure application that encodes a plain text file into another file using Huffman compression techniques.

## Motivation

This is a really small project created to test the Clojure language, and learn in the process. I hope it can be useful for other people as well.

## How to run the project

Clojure runs in the Java virtual machine (JVM). In order to run the project, the Clojure runtime environment is required as well.

The easiest way to run this project is using [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/). Download it and run it. It will download all dependencies for you.

Once Leiningen is installed and included in the path, the following command can be executed from the project folder (folder where project.clj file is located)

    lein run

That's it!
